# Contributing

First of all: thank you for helping keep the light on ðŸŒ•

## How to contribute
1. Check if there's already an open Issue for what you want to add or fix.
2. If not â€” create an Issue describing:
   - what changed in Pharos,
   - which doc is affected,
   - and what should be updated.
3. Make a pull request with your proposed change.

## Style guidelines
- Keep language simple. Imagine you're explaining to someone who just joined the Discord today.
- No leaking private/internal info.
- Do not promise rewards, drops, payouts, etc.
- Avoid words that trigger moderation / red flags like "farm", "multi-account abuse", etc. Talk about "participation", "activity", "contribution".

## Attribution
If your PR gets merged, you can add yourself to the "Contributors" section in README.
