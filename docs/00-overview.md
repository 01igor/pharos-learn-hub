# 0. What is Pharos?

Pharos is an ecosystem built around the idea of **guiding users** â€” like a lighthouse guides ships.

Core ideas:
- Access: onboarding people into Web3 without pain.
- Discovery: helping users find what matters, not just "ape into random stuff".
- Community: humans first. Tech is important, but culture is the engine.

Right now (Atlantic Testnet phase), people can:
- join early,
- get familiar with tooling,
- explore integrations being built around Pharos,
- give feedback and report issues.
