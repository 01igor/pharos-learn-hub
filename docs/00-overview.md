#  What is Pharos?

Pharos Network — Overview
What is Pharos Network

Pharos Network is a modular, high-performance EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain, built on the concept of Deep Parallel Architecture for Web3 utilities, Real-World Assets (RWAs), and cross-chain liquidity.
It’s designed to solve scalability, performance, and interoperability challenges that limit most modern blockchains.

The network consists of three core layers:

L1-Base – provides high data availability and hardware acceleration.

L1-Core – a globally distributed blockchain with sub-second finality and high throughput.

L1-Extension – expands the network through SPNs (Special Processing Networks), Native Restaking, and cross-SPN interoperability.

Why it matters

Pharos was built to address critical bottlenecks in existing blockchain infrastructures — problems like limited throughput, state bloat, and isolated ecosystems.
By combining modular architecture with deep parallel execution, Pharos delivers a scalable environment capable of supporting billions of users and applications across industries.

Core Technologies

Modular Stack
Every layer and component in Pharos is open and customizable, allowing developers and partners to design their own infrastructure solutions on top of the core network.

SPNs (Special Processing Networks)
Specialized subnetworks dedicated to specific purposes — such as AI, ZKML, high-frequency trading, or privacy-focused environments.

Native Restaking
A unique restaking mechanism where users stake their assets → receive a staking certificate (stP) → and restake it across SPNs to earn additional rewards while contributing to network security.

Decentralized Data Exchange Protocol
Ensures seamless communication and data transfer between different SPNs and core layers.

Adaptive Restaking Interaction Protocol (ARIP)
Coordinates validation, security, and reward mechanisms between the main chain and extended subnetworks.
