# 2. Getting test tokens

To interact with Atlantic Testnet you need test assets.
These are not real funds.

## Option A: Faucet
Some faucets will send you a small amount of native test tokens to your address.

Typical flow:
1. Paste your wallet address.
2. Click "Request".
3. Wait for the transaction to land.

Notes:
- Faucets often have cooldowns.
- Sometimes they are empty / rate-limited. That's normal.

## Option B: Swap / bridge from other testnets
Some services let you:
- bring testnet assets from networks like Sepolia / Holesky / Blast testnets,
- or even pay a tiny real fee by card and receive test tokens.

After that you can convert those assets into test $PHAROS on Atlantic Testnet.

âš  Security tip:
Only use bridges / faucets shared by official Pharos channels or trusted community members.
Never share your seed phrase.
