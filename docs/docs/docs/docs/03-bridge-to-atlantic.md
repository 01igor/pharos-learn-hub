# 3. Bridge into Atlantic Testnet

A "bridge" is a tool that moves assets from one network to another.

High-level flow:
1. Connect your wallet.
2. Select source network (for example: Sepolia testnet).
3. Select destination: Atlantic Testnet.
4. Choose amount.
5. Confirm.

After bridging:
- You should see tokens in your wallet on Atlantic.
- If not, make sure MetaMask is actually switched to Atlantic Testnet.

Troubleshooting:
- Sometimes bridges show "Pending" for a while. This can be normal.
- If it's stuck, copy the transaction hash and check it in the explorer (see section 4).
