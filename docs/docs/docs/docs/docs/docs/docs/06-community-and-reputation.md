# 6. Community & Reputation

Pharos is very community-driven.
People notice effort.

Ways to stand out (without being cringe):
- Be helpful in chat. Answer simple questions new people ask.
- Report bugs clearly (what happened, how to reproduce).
- Create memes, art, or mini-threads in Pharos style.
- Stay active in real conversations, not low-effort spam.

Consistency >>> noise.
