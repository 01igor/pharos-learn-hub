# 5. What can I actually do in the testnet?

Typical early actions:

- Send tokens between your own wallets.
- Try basic swaps / transfers in ecosystem apps.
- Interact with contracts deployed by the team or partners.
- Give feedback if something is broken or confusing.

Tips:
- Keep notes: what worked / what bugged / what UI was unclear.
- Screenshots of weird behavior are extremely valuable to the team.

Golden rule:
You're not just "clicking buttons".
You're stress-testing the experience so the final product is smoother for normal users.
