# 4. How to check your balance and transactions

## What is an explorer?
An explorer is a website where you can search:
- your wallet address,
- a transaction hash,
- a block number.

It shows:
- did your transaction succeed,
- how much gas was used,
- which tokens are in your wallet.

## Steps:
1. Copy your wallet address (0x...).
2. Paste it into the Atlantic Testnet explorer search bar.
3. You'll see your balance and latest transactions.

If something fails:
- Red status = reverted / failed.
- Green / success = confirmed.

Why this matters:
You don't have to guess "did it work?"
The explorer is the source of truth.
